# RAG-fromScratch

👨🏻‍💻 The Python notebook contains both code and notes produced during this Daniel Bourke YouTube lesson. The main focus here was *not* to produce an optimized and scalable RAG pipeline, but rather to build intuition behind the core RAG process—without using frameworks such as LangChain or LlamaIndex, just Python with minimal tools.

By building this RAG pipeline from scratch, I was able to work with PDF loading and preprocessing, embedding models, similarity search, running an LLM locally, and prompt augmentation.

Feel free to check out the notebook!
